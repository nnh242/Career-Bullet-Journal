# Career-Bullet-Journal
This is a bullet journal created for job searching, API-hack from job search APIs such as dice and github jobs.
The idea of the bullet journal is to quickly note down and organize any process with ease. The purpose of this API project is to help users get the job search done in an organized way.

The landing page provides a cover for the journal providing users with a simple introudction to the features of the app, this app is where users can search for jobs, get things done and stay organized. Users can open the journal with a simple but insipiring provided passcode.

The Job Search feature implements the API from Dice.com. Users can search for jobs by entering the job title or skill in the search Term or by ZipCode. The results are sorted by posting age by ascending order, so the newest post is always on top.

The Notes feature consists of two simple bullet-point-style note-cards where users can create a to-do list and a list of anything. This is the main idea of a bullet journal where users can make any random list to organize the job search process. Examples: Skills list, Deal breaker list, dream company list, etc.

The Calendar feature is a clever implementation of the FullCalendar plugin allowing user to create a single event then drag event to increase/decrease duration or to move event to another day.
